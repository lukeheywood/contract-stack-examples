# Philosophy

This folder captures the principles that guide the work in this repository.

These are not beliefs to adopt.
They are lenses I use when designing systems.

A few of those lenses:

- Systems drift because humans drift
- Governance does not remove consequence — it forces it earlier
- Optimism is not a virtue in system design
- If a system needs discipline to stay correct, it is already broken

Nothing here is prescriptive.
It exists to explain why the contracts look the way they do.
